cat("Sometimes I feel like being human is kind of boring. Do you feel like being an alien is fun?
    What color are you? Most people think when we find you you'll be green and slimy and have big slanty eyes,
    but I don't know. I think you might be grey and yellow and have hands for eyes, or you might just like
    just like humans but a little taller. My name is James by the way. What's your name? If aliens have names.")
